Finally finished version 1.0 of my "vibe coded" game entry to the @SuperSeed competition - Superseed Defense. Never touched game development or learnt much code beyond basic Python so this was a definite learning curve for me. God knows how many prompts later but I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

Loved tower defense games growing up and figured it would be a good way to nicely incorporate key ideas from the ecosystem.

All code was AI generated with a mixture of LLMs - started with ChatGPT, but ran into the issue of it continually fixing one thing but breaking another, so I switched to Cursor which had similar issues but overall did a much better job. 

Visual art was all AI-generated. Wanted a 2D pixel style aesthetic, but since I'm no artist I wasn't sure how to get things animated or turned into a spritesheet. Ended up generating basic assets using ChatGPT (fortunately the latest update made these much better than I expected). I then animated them with Kling and split the frames until I had a smooth enough animation cycle. With more time I'd animate more of the items/enemies but I'm happy with the basics done.
